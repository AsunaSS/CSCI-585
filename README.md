## Website: https://bytes.usc.edu/cs585/s23-da-taaa/home/index.html
The link above leads to the official website of the courses provided by Saty. It includes **syllabus**, **ppt**, **homework and exam descriptions**, and **extra content**.

## Assignments(30%)
Note that for assignment #2, there is a bonus point but the maximum point will still be 6. I also uploaded the rubrics for each assignment except for assignment #5. 
| No. | Related Topic | Score |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------|
| 1  | (E)ER diagram  | 6/6 |
| 2  | SQL  | 6/6 |
| 3  | Spatial data  | 6/6 |
| 4  | NoSQL | 6/6 |

## [Personal Note](https://github.com/AsunaSS/CSCI-585/releases/download/Note/CSCI585_Note.pdf)
This PDF records all my class notes, which contains my personal understanding of all key knowledge of this course. It summarizes all the knowledge that the midterm and final exam may cover. However, this document alone **will not help you do well on the exam**. According to 23Spring's experience, the exam will be **completely open to the Internet and even ChatGPT**. It means that you must understand the knowledge points of the course or hand over your fate to GPT.

## Exams(35%+35%)
This course has two exams, each one is 35%. There are 10 bonus points for midterm exam and 6 bonus points for final exam, but the maximum point will still be 35 for both. I uploaded the [rubrics for midterm exam]() and *my own answers for final exam* since Saty didn't provide the rubrics for final.
